# Code for Canada - Developers' Challenge

Attached is my solution for the coding challenge received as part of my application to the "Code for Canada" FellowShip.  

My solution is written in _Swift_, and took me about 30 minutes to write.  

-----
### Requirements  
- Swift 3 compiler (Installed separately on Linux. Comes embedded with XCode on Mac OS)
- Mac OS 10.11+ (or Ubuntu Linux 14.04+)
- All files of this repo to be placed in the same directory

### Usage
Open your terminal, go to the root of the directory where you copied this repo, then run the following command:  
`swift Solution.swift`

  
P.S you can follow the same instruction to get a similar report for a different dataset. Everything will work the same way as long as you have the same structure and file name as 'dev-challenge-data.csv' for your input.
